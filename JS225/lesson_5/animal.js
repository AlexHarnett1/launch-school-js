Given a class Animal create two classes Cat and Dog that inherit from it.

The Cat constructor should take 3 arguments, name, age and status. Cats should always
have a leg count of 4 and a species of cat. Also, the introduce method should be identical
to the inherited one except, after the returned phrase, there should be a single space and
the words Meow meow!.

The Dog constructor should take 4 arguments, name, age and status and master. Dogs should
always have a leg count of 4 and a species of dog. Dogs have the same introduce method 
as any other animal, but they have their own method called greetMaster(), which accepts 
no arguments and returns Hello (master's name)! Woof, woof!. (Make sure you replace 
(master's name) with the name of the dog's master.)
